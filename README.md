GeoNotif is a location-based task manager application using which users can add tasks they need to do at particular geographical locations. 

The app, which runs as a service, will remind users of their incomplete tasks based on their current location. The app also allows users to create groups for activities and manage task lists. It will handle the shared data across users in these groups and distinguish between individual and group tasks.

GeoNotif rewards users for items they check off their lists by providing the limited ability to assign tasks to other users in their network.

### Features
